            <h3>
                Purpose
            </h3><span>HFF is developing the next generation of financial risk and optimization software focused on intraday and high speed trading. HFFâ€™s product will solve the problem of stale data, and thereby enable intraday position analysis. The overnight risk and optimization assessment mode of communication through written reports is not optimal for rapid intraday trading. There is a need for increased reliance on visualization tools and for pro-forma scenario analysis developed under the guidance of, and in interaction with, client investment strategies. The HFF Scenario Engine under development by HFF will allow for valuation and price forecasting of many (100K and more) security prices enabling fast "What-If" analysis and risk budgeting. In addition to monitoring risk positions on an intraday basis, we are proposing computer assisted human decision for intraday trading. The high speed trading platform is a longer range goal. With three (or even two) distinct time windows for risk assessment (overnight, intraday, high speed), we will also develop a blended time horizon prediction framework, linking the distinct time scales through conditional probabilities for the volatilities.</span><br><br>
            <h3>
                Scope
            </h3><span>Intellectually, the effort builds on high performance computing, advanced statistical methods, the development of novel algorithms and on a novel combination of proven algorithms. Statistical families which reflect the heavy tails and the long range dependence characteristic of financial time series data are heavily used. Additional details are available on a confidential basis subject to execution of an appropriate NDA.</span><br><br>
            <h3>
                Personnel
            </h3><span>HFF at Stony Brook University is a team of some 35 faculty members and some 25 graduate students, spanning four universities. The team is most unusual in its scope, breadth, power and size. Prominent names in high speed trading and risk management have leading roles in this Institute. Major technologies proven useful for high speed trading (Finance, Statistics, High Performance Computing, Numerical Methods, Stochastic Modeling, and Signal Processing) are represented in HFF by leaders with international reputations. No more than a few comparable efforts exist anywhere today.</span><br><br>
            <h3>
                Timeline
            </h3><span>Our development schedule is to have a first usable product within a year, with an ability to support external users. Development will continue for another year to round out the product offering and for a third year to add client specific features and asset classes as needed.</span><br>
